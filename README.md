# Wheel of Islam

**Wheel of Islam** is a modern, interactive web application designed to help Muslim youth—especially those growing up in Western contexts—reconnect with their faith in a non-judgmental, engaging, and personalized way.

At its core, the app features a visually appealing “wheel” interface, where each segment represents a foundational topic of Islam (such as Worship, Tazkiyyah, Qur’an, Prophetic Guidance, and more). Users can freely explore any topic at their own pace, with the app providing approachable, bite-sized knowledge and actionable steps tailored to their current level of understanding and practice.

To further support users facing doubts, misconceptions, or challenging questions—often encountered in Western environments—the app includes the **Dawah Guide**. This feature allows users to anonymously submit any statement, question, or doubt they’ve heard (e.g., “God does not exist,” “Why do Muslims pray five times a day?”). The Dawah Guide responds with empathetic, faith-based, and contextually relevant answers, powered by a combination of AI and pre-approved responses, and always encourages further exploration and learning.

## Key Features
- **Non-linear, user-driven exploration** of core Islamic topics via the interactive wheel.
- **Personalized content and micro-actions** based on the user’s current level and interests.
- **Dawah Guide:** An AI-powered assistant for addressing doubts, misconceptions, and questions in a safe, anonymous, and supportive environment.
- **Resource links and further reading** for users who want to deepen their understanding.
- **Modern, mobile-friendly design** tailored for Gen Z, with a focus on accessibility, inclusivity, and positive reinforcement.

**Mission:**
To provide Muslim youth with a safe, engaging, and empowering digital space to learn, reflect, and grow in their faith—starting from wherever they are, and always without judgment or overwhelm.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
